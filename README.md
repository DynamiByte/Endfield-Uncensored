## Disclaimer

This tool modifies game files at runtime. Use at your own risk.
Dont be a dumbass and share screenshots with your UID that could only look that way with this mod.
Getting banned for using this like a dumbass is YOUR fault, not mine.

## How-to
1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/DynamiByte/Endfield-Uncensored/releases) page
3. Run `Endfield Uncensored.exe` **It requires Administrator** 
4. Launch Endfield as you normally would, the program will inject and close automatically.

### Notes
If you dont wan't to use the GUI application, you can build the [d3d12.dll from source](https://github.com/DynamiByte/Endfield-Uncensored/blob/master/dll%20src/d3d12.c).
With minor modification, you can just use a 3dmigoto loader to inject this.
